
At the most abstract level, we want to be able to do the following: 

A movie is specified as Movie: JPEGFile[n-1]   

MoviePromoter requirements:  
  setup initial ownership of all frames to self 
  Sell blocks of frames to owners 
    (initial owners can be wholesale, who onsell to retail owners) 

Owner requirements: 
  independently of the archival storage of the whole movie, and however ownership is currently recorded 
  - can prove ownership of a particular image 
  - can prove an image to be part of a particular movie at particular frameNo 
  - can transfer ownership, together with ability to do the above proofs, of sub-blocks owned  

Implementation Requirements:
  - Image storage can be outsourced (e.g. to IPFS)  
  - ownership can be recorded either on or off chain 
  - owner can transfer between on and off chain recording of ownership
  - off chain transfers can be processed in bulk with efficient on chain computations
